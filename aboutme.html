<h1>Betselot Baffa</h1>
 </head>


<p>My name is Betselot Baffa, I am 16 years old and I am a junior at Tyee High School in SeaTac,WA. I have one younger brother and no sister. 
 I grew up in a small town called Durame. The town I grew up had a completely different culture than the U.S.,so it was a little hard for me to adapt the American culture.
  I am passionate about helping street children and homeless people. I am planning on majoring Computer Science.
